# Future Improvements

 There are several enhancements planned to make it even better in the future as follows:

## 1. Dark Mode

A theme switch button will allow users to toggle between light and dark mode for better readability and personal preference.



## 2. Backend Contact Form

The contact section will be upgraded to store or send submitted messages to email or a database using backend technologies like PHP, Node.js, or Firebase.

## 3. Better Animation Experience

More dynamic CSS transitions and section-based reveal animations will make the scrolling experience smoother and more engaging.

## 4. Detailed Project Pages

Each project card will open a dedicated page with description, screenshots, features, and source code links.

## 5. Performance Optimization

Unused CSS will be minimized and images compressed to improve loading speed.
