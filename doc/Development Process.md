# Development Process

## 1. Planning

The development started by deciding the sections needed in the portfolio website such as Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact. The layout plan helped in organizing what information would go where.

## 2. HTML Structure

The basic webpage structure was created using HTML5. Headings, text, images, navigation links, buttons, and project placeholders were added to form the skeleton of the website.

## 3. CSS Styling

CSS3 was used to design the website with a soft red theme, rounded corners, and clean typography. Flexbox and CSS Grid were applied to arrange elements and make the layout adaptable to different screen sizes.

## 4. Animations & Interactions

Hover effects, image transitions using `@keyframes`, smooth scrolling, and a sticky navbar were implemented to make the UI more engaging and easy to navigate.

## 5. Testing & Finalization

The site was tested on multiple screen sizes and adjusted until a clean, modern, and responsive design was completed.
