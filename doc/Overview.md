# Overview

This Personal Portfolio Website is a single-page web project developed using HTML5 and CSS3. It is designed to showcase personal information, skills, projects, and contact details in a clean and modern layout. The goal of the website is to provide a professional digital presence for a student or beginner in web development, making it easy for visitors to learn about their profile and work.

The design follows a soft red theme with smooth gradients, rounded corners, and clean typography to create a friendly and elegant appearance. The layout is responsive, meaning it adjusts automatically to different screen sizes such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

The site also includes interactive elements like hover effects, a CSS-only image slider, a sticky header, and smooth scrolling. All styling and animations are done using pure CSS without external libraries.

Overall, the website is simple to customize and suitable as a starting portfolio for showcasing skills and projects professionally.
