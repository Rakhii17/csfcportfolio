# Rakhi — Personal Portfolio Website

A clean, modern, and responsive personal portfolio website created using **HTML5 and CSS3**. This project showcases my profile, skills, project work, and contact information in a visually appealing layout. The site is built without any external frameworks or JavaScript libraries, using only pure HTML and CSS.

# 📖 Project Description

This repository contains the complete source code of my portfolio website.
The design features a **soft pink theme** with shades of red, rounded elements, smooth animations, and simple typography (Poppins).

The website is created as a **single-page portfolio**, where the navigation menu smoothly scrolls to different sections such as:

* About
* Skills
* Projects
* Contact

It aims to give a quick and professional overview of my learning journey as a B.Tech CSE student.

# ✨ Key Features

1. **Responsive Design**
   Layout built using CSS Grid and Flexbox, making the site look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

2. **CSS-Only Project Image Slider**
   Each project card uses a custom `@keyframes` animation that gently transitions between screenshots automatically without JavaScript.

3. **Sticky Header Navigation**
   The header stays visible at the top while scrolling for easier navigation.

4. **Smooth Page Scrolling**
   All anchor links and the "Back to Top" button use CSS’s native smooth scrolling.

5. **Modern UI Elements**

   * Hover animations on skill cards
   * Circular profile image with border and shadow
   * Section cards with soft shadows
   * Gradient headers and soft theme colors

6. **CSS Variables**
   Custom `:root` variables make color and theme customization easy.
